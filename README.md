These data were collected by GPS collars worn by cattle at three different ranches during the summers of 2020 and 2021. The table GPSCollarData includes a collar ID number which is unique to each animal, a timestamp, and a set of coordinates. The coordinates are in WGS 1984, but they were displaced by a fixed x and y amount to keep the ranch locations private. The table CollarToHerd identifies the herd associated with each collar ID. These data were used to create a model to understand animal leadership by predicting herd movement.
